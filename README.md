This project is building a marketing campaign through customer personality analysis, where I utilized clustering techniques for customer segmentation based on their background information, purchasing history, and product preferences. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the practical applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios, particularly in enhancing user experiences and driving business growth.
